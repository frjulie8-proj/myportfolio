# About Me

Hi, my name is Julie. I'm originally from Vietnam and France, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics at Boston University.

Before graduate school, I worked in a B2B business development role in Brooklyn, New York, where I supported sales strategy and worked directly with clients. That experience helped me understand how data connects to real business outcomes.

During my master's program, I've worked extensively with SQL, R, and Python for data cleaning, modeling, and analysis. I've built structured datasets and dashboards that translate raw data into actionable insights for stakeholders.

I enjoy working at the intersection of data and business because it's rewarding to see how rigorous analysis directly supports strategic decision-making and drives measurable outcomes.

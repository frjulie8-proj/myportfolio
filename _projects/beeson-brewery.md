one_liner: Evaluated a $150K capital investment decision under demand uncertainty, channel mix trade-offs, and downside liquidity risk.
summary: Evaluated a $150K capital investment under demand uncertainty, channel strategy trade-offs, and downside risk constraints.
overview: "Evaluated a $150K capital investment in a 40-barrel microbrewery with ~476,160 pints/year capacity. Built a utilization-driven model to estimate break-even utilization and 3-year payback feasibility under retail vs wholesale channel trade-offs."
callout_title: "Key Constraint"
callout_text: "30-day shelf life limits inventory flexibility and increases spoilage risk during seasonal dips."
modeling:
  - "Converted 8 tanks × 1,240 pints/week into annual capacity (~476K pints)"
  - "Contribution margin (net of excise tax) modeled by channel mix"
  - "Incorporated labor (1 brewmaster + 1 worker) and post-Year 1 maintenance increase"
  - "Break-even utilization rate estimated under retail-heavy, wholesale-heavy, and blended scenarios"
  - "Payback period modeled over 3 years"
  - "Cash vs financed comparison included in capital structure scenarios"
  - "Applied gradual utilization ramp to reflect production lag and learning curve"
risk:
  - "Under-utilization risk below break-even threshold"
  - "Wholesale margin compression vs retail pricing"
  - "Cannibalization risk of higher-margin external craft taps"
  - "Seasonality + spoilage interaction from Fenway traffic variability with 30-day shelf-life"
  - "Fixed-capacity constraint (40 bbl system cannot scale down if demand underperforms)"
  - "Opportunity cost of $150K vs alternative uses (renovation, marketing, debt reduction)"
decision:
  - "Financial viability depends primarily on sustained utilization and retail channel share"
  - "Proceed only if utilization exceeds X%"
  - "Retail mix >= Y% to preserve contribution margin"
  - "Standalone cash flow positive post-Year 1"
  - "Downside scenario must not threaten core restaurant operations"
  - "If demand growth underperforms or wholesale mix dominates, payback extends materially beyond target horizon"
plan:
  - "Assess feasibility under operational and regulatory constraints"
  - "Compare channel mix economics (retail vs wholesale)"
  - "Define a rule-based investment decision threshold"

snapshot:
  - "Role: Quantitative decision analysis"
  - "Type: Capital investment evaluation"
  - "Tools: Excel/R (modeling), KPI design"
  - "Decision: Go / modify / no-go"

context: "The restaurant (100 seats, Fenway location) is evaluating installation of a turnkey 40-barrel system requiring 1 brewmaster and 1 operator. Core constraints include 8 tanks × 1,240 pints/week, a 1-week production cycle, and a 30-day shelf life, which increase spoilage exposure during seasonal demand dips. The brewery is structured as a separate business unit, requiring stand-alone viability rather than restaurant cross-subsidization. Financing is available, introducing interest cost while reducing upfront cash exposure."
strategic_positioning_question: "Are we a restaurant that brews beer, or a brewery that serves food?"

business_question: "Should the business invest in the microbrewery system, modify the proposal, or decline based on financial viability and strategic fit?"
core_tension: "The decision is not simply about production capacity. It is about whether incremental beer margin justifies fixed capital risk under demand uncertainty."

constraints:
  - "Max capacity ~476,160 pints/year"
  - "One-week production cycle"
  - "30-day cold storage life for product"
  - "Two distribution models: retail vs wholesale"

primary_risk_drivers:
  - "Utilization volatility"
  - "Cannibalization of existing beer sales"
  - "Seasonality and 30-day spoilage constraint"
  - "Wholesale margin compression"

approach:
  - "Translate operational constraints into capacity model"
  - "Define KPIs and success thresholds"
  - "Compare scenario trade-offs between channels"

insights:
  - "Primary risk driver: demand/utilization uncertainty"
  - "Retail vs wholesale trade-off: margin vs volume stability"
  - "Decision should be threshold-based (utilization + mix)"

decision_framework:
  - "Proceed only if projected utilization exceeds X%"
  - "Maintain retail mix above Y% to protect margins"
  - "Operational plan must support inventory turnover within 30 days"

appendix: "\"Utilization, not volume, determines viability.\" \"Below break-even utilization, fixed capacity becomes a liability.\""

  - "Decision: Go / modify / no-go"

context: "An existing restaurant is considering investing in a turnkey 40-barrel microbrewery system to produce craft beer for retail and/or wholesale distribution."

constraints:

  - "Two distribution models: retail vs wholesale"

approach:

insights:
  - "Primary risk driver: demand/utilization uncertainty"
  - "Retail vs wholesale trade-off: margin vs volume stability"
  - "Decision should be threshold-based (utilization + mix)"

decision_framework:
  - "Proceed only if projected utilization exceeds X%"
  - "Maintain retail mix above Y% to protect margins"
  - "Operational plan must support inventory turnover within 30 days"
